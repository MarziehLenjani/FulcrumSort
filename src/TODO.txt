TODOs for Data generator APIs 
	Varying key size 32 vs 64 (8/16 ??)
	Varying types (integer and float)
	Key-only sorting vs. Key-value sorting 
	Uniform distribution
	Normal distribution by varying standard deviation
	Skewed distributions
	Varying key entropy (bits) 
	“repeatedly applying the bitwise AND operation to uniform random distributions, which increasingly skews the distribution towards keys with fewer bits set.”
